# Slipstream - Sample Project
Slipstream is a [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite) package, offering a light weight class interface for [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) development; a handy and organized way to ride the slipstream of the great and evolving Meteor framework. My mission with this project is to address a few key concerns with developing a solid production ready system for Meteor.

`NOTE:` This project employs the use of Meteorite, a vital tool for any prospective Meteor developer.
